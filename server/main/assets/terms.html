          <li>You may not use the Service to harass, threaten, or otherwise violate the rights of others.</li>
          <li>You may attempt to find exploits or bugs in the game's software - but never to harm other users.</li>

          <li>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continuing to use the Service after updates means you

        <h2>5. Termination</h2>
        <ul>
