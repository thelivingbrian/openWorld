                    Development of the Bloopworld engine started in December of 2023.

                <p>
                    Currently, in bloopworld, the internet can compete in a game of capture the flag - First team to 100 wins!
                </p><br />
                <p>
                    I'm not a game developer - Bloopworld is partly an experiment taken too far, partly a love letter to the web stack.
